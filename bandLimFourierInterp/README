BandLimFourierInterp
====================

BandLimFourierInterp is a free open-source program that can be used with either GNU Octave or MATLAB. It is licensed under version 3 of the GNU general public license.

The program itself is based on the idea presented in "Spectral Methods in MATLAB" by Lloyd N. Trefethen to use shifted sinc(x) functions for 1D interpolation of functions on unbounded domains. We have extended this idea to general 1D & 2D periodic functions by choosing appropriate periodic sinc's and have tried to make the implementation as speedy and memory efficient as possible (especially in 2D). 

It is worth noting that if you only need a more finely sampled version of the original signal, then zero-padding the Fourier spectrum is quite sufficient and fast, and you can probably find other software to do this for you. This code is intended for situations where the signal must be evaluated at a specific set of points that you would prescribe.

For more details on how to use the functions, see the doc-strings at the top of bandLimFourierInterp1D.m & bandLimFourierInterp2D.m, or type e.g., "help bandLimFourierInterp2d.m" in Octave or MATLAB.
